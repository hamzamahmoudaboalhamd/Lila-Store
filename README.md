## ‚ú® Project Overview

The **Lila Store** is a dynamic, fully responsive front-end template designed specifically for modern e-commerce. This project showcases the ability to build a rich user interface that handles multiple products, dynamic data, and complex interactions using a modular JavaScript structure.

### Key Skills Demonstrated:

* **E-commerce UX:** Optimized layout featuring clear product listings, prominent CTAs, and easy navigation.
* **Modular JavaScript:** Separation of concerns across multiple `.js` files for data (`items_home.js`), core logic (`main.js`), and component functionality (`swiper.js`).
* **Third-Party Integration:** Successful implementation of the **Swiper.js library** for advanced, touch-friendly product carousels/sliders.
* **Responsive Grid Design:** Mastery of CSS to display product cards effectively across mobile and desktop screens.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure and Technical Breakdown

The advanced nature of this project is best seen in its well-organized JavaScript folder structure.

### 1. The Dynamic Core (JS Directory)

The JavaScript files work together to inject data and control dynamic elements:

| File | Primary Function | Technical Skill Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`items_home.js`** | **Data Mockup:** Defines the array of objects containing product information displayed on the page. | Simulating **Data Fetching/API Integration** from a separate file. |
| **`swiper.js`** | **Carousel Setup:** Initializes and configures the Swiper component on the page (e.g., setting loop, speed, and pagination). | **Library Configuration** and adapting external code to project needs. |
| **`main.js`** | **Global Interactivity:** Handles basic site interactions, such as opening/closing the cart view, toggling the mobile menu, or processing initial product data. | **Event Handling** and **DOM Rendering** based on product data. |

### 2. Styling and Layout (`style.css`)

The CSS file contains the custom rules for e-commerce specific elements:

* **Product Card Styling:** Detailed styling for hover effects, price display, and product image containers.
* **Grid Layout:** Efficient use of CSS Grid or Flexbox to manage the main catalogue view.
